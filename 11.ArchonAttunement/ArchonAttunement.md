## The Archon's Aetherium Attunement

In the celestial realm of **Eldoria**, a rare cosmic convergence is imminent. You are an **Archon**, a master of arcane energies, tasked with a ritual of paramount importance: absorbing power from scattered **Aetherium Caches** to fortify the realm’s fading wards.

You have located `n` caches, and the ritual window lasts for exactly `H` Lunar Cycles. Your power is determined by an **Attunement Factor**, `k`. In a single Lunar Cycle, you can focus on one cache and absorb up to `k` units of Aetherium from it. If a cache contains `k` or fewer units, you drain it completely in that cycle.

Your life force is finite, so you must perform the ritual with the minimum possible effort. Your task is to find the **minimum integer Attunement Factor `k`** that allows you to drain all `n` caches within the given `H` cycles.

-----

### Input Format

-   The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
-   The first line of each test case contains two integers, $N$ and $H$ — the number of Aetherium caches and the number of available Lunar Cycles.
-   The second line of each test case contains $N$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ — the amount of Aetherium in each cache.

-----

### Constraints

-   $1 \le N \le 10^4$
-   $N \le H \le 10^9$
-   $1 \le c_i \le 10^9$
-   The sum of $N$ over all test cases will not exceed $10^4$.

-----

### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer on a new line — the minimum integer `k` required to complete the ritual in time.
