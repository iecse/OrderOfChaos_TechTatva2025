# Enchanted Sorting of Runes

You are given an array of mystical runes `nums`.  
Your task is to perform a **dual enchantment:**
- **Even runes** must be aligned in **ascending order of power** (weakest to strongest).
- **Odd runes** must be aligned in **descending order of power**.(strongest to weakest).
- But beware! Each rune must **remain bound to its original slot** in the array â€” even runes only swap with other even runes, and odd runes only with other odd runes.
